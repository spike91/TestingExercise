This small application include ui-grid, jquery and bootstrap libraries.
jquery and bootstrap - most populars libraries for front-end.
ui-grid - when go to google with 'angularjs grid', you find ag-grid and ui-grid first. Tried ui-grid, not bad, but for using some features need to inject its manually to module.
